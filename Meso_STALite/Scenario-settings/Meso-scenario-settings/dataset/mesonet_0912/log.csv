Step 1: Reading input data
Step 1.1: Reading section [demand_period] in setting.csv...
number of demand periods = 1
Step 1.2: Reading section [link_type] in setting.csv...
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 1 is 3
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 2 is 2
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 3 is 2
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 4 is 2
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 20 is 1
important: traffic_flow_code on link type 99 is 1
number of link types = 7
Step 1.3: Reading section [agent_type] in setting.csv...
number of agent typess = 1
Step 1.4: Reading node data in node.csv...
number of nodes = 1360
Step 1.5: Initializing O-D zone vector...
number of zones = 25
Step 1.6: Reading link data in link.csv... 
number of links = 1502
number of links =1552
Step 1.7: Reading service arc in timing.csv...

Step 1.8: Reading file section [demand_file_list] in setting.csv...
number of timing records = 0

allocating 4D memory for 0 zones
allocating 3D memory for 0

Step 1.8: Reading file section [demand_file_list] in setting.csv...
o_zone_id:1020, d_zone_id: 2005, value = 2200.000000
total_demand_volume is 2200.000000

Step 2: Assigning computing tasks to memory blocks...
There are 4 networks in memory.

Step 3: Column Generation for Traffic Assignment...
